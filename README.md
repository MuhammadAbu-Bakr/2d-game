# 2D Top-Down Pixel Art Game (Java + Swing)

**@author Muhammad Abu-Bakr**

A beginner-friendly 2D top-down pixel art game built in Java using Swing for UI. This project is one of my first steps into game development, so the code may include unnecessary parts or bugs — it's mainly for learning purposes.

## Features
- Pixel-art styled graphics in top-down perspective
- Basic player movement using keyboard inputs (WASD or arrow keys)
- Simple game loop and rendering system
- UI created entirely using Java Swing

## Technologies
- Java (JDK 8 or higher)
- Java Swing (for rendering and interface)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MuhammadAbu-Bakr/2d-game.git
   cd 2D-game
   ```

2. Compile and run:
   ```bash
   javac Code/Main.java
   
   ```
  



## Notes
- The game may contain redundant or unoptimized code — improvements are encouraged.
- It's designed as a playground for learning game dev basics in Java.
